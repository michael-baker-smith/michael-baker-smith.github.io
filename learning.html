              <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h3>
              <p>My long term goal and career pathway is obviously to get a job in IT. Either in Networking/Support or as a Web Developer. My ideal career pathway would be a job I’d feel comfortable in while continuing my education within IT.</p>
              <p>Right now I feel that junior web or software development would be fun and challenging.</p>

              <h3>What non-technical skills I’d like to see more developed while at Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>My communication skills could you some work. Especially within Dev Academy Foundations, it can be a bit overwhelming with how many people post daily on Stack. I’m not sure what I can contribute to the conversations, so I mostly just give thumbs up emojis.</p>
              <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                •	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
                •	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
