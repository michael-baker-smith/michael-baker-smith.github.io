              <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h3>
              <p>My long term goal and career pathway is obviously to get a job in IT. Either in Networking/Support or as a Web Developer. My ideal career pathway would be a job I’d feel comfortable in while continuing my education within IT.</p>
              <p>Right now I feel that junior web or software development would be fun and challenging.</p>

              <h3>What non-technical skills I’d like to see more developed while at Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>My communication skills could you some work. Especially within Dev Academy Foundations, it can be a bit overwhelming with how many people post daily on Stack. I’m not sure what I can contribute to the conversations, so I mostly just give thumbs up emojis.</p>
              <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
              <h4>•	An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
              <p>My commitment to this programme is to work on it at least a couple of hours everyday in foundations even if I’ve finished that weeks sprint. With the bootcamp I intend to be there everyday on time and willing to learn and be supportive to Dev Academy student and faculty members.</p>
              <h4>•	What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>
              <p>Take a break and/or reach out for help within and outside Dev Academy</p>
              <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
              <p>I am committed to seeking help only after I’ve finished trying on my own. I will try to spend only a couple of hours trying to figure something out. Then reach out to Slack and Dev Academy staff.</p>
              <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
              <p>I expect support and understanding with constructive criticism that will help me develop my skills</p>
              <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
              <p>I don’t at present have any commitments that take my focus or time away from study</p>
