              <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
              <p>It is your brain’s ability to restructure and form new neural connections. If we start to learn the piano, we usually begun by engaging in repetitive practice and learning to read musical notes. Doing this creates new pathways in our brain. People used to believe that the brain’s capabilities for learning were fixed at a certain age, but new research shows that the brain doesn’t stop changing in response to learning. Understanding this, benefits everyone who feels limited by their current knowledge and skills.</p>
              <h3>How can we increase neuroplasticity?</h3>
              <p>Exercise and health play an important part in how our we learn. So does repetitive practice. Repeating a activity and reviewing the material in different ways, help build stronger connections in the brain.</p>
              <h3>Growth</h3>
              <p>It is about understanding that talents, and abilities can develop through practice, good teachings, and perseverance. A fixed mindset is when you believe the opposite, that everything static and unchangeable. A growth mindset is important to have for programming because it is challenging. You will come across subjects or problem that won’t be solved easily and someone with a fixed mindset may be overwhelmed and give up more easily. It is better to create a passion for learning than a hunger for approval.</p>
