              <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
              <p><em>“The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.”</em>Oxford Languages</p>
              <p>Basically, to recognize, comprehend and manage our own emotions and the emotions of others. Some research claim it is mostly inborn characteristics while others say it can be learned and strengthened.</p>
              <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
              <p>IQ measures an individual’s reasoning and academic competency abilities. How we plan, strategize and our understanding of abstract ideas. Even our grasp and use of language can be defined by IQ.</p>
              <p>Emotional intelligence is how we use our awareness of our emotions to guide our behaviour. People with high EQ may find it easier to:</p>
              <ul class="points">
                <li>Control our own impulses, delay gratification and withstand temptations</li>
                <li>Resolve conflicts with others</li>
                <li>Communicate more effectively</li>
                <li>Identify positive or negative emotions in yourself and others</li>
                <li>Empathize with people</li>
                <li>Adapt your behaviour and feelings to different situations</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
              <p>Imagine a world where no one could understand when a friend or family member was happy, sad or angry. It would suck. Human being are social animals and like to express how selves. I mean, we made emojis for this very reason.</p>
