              <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
              <p>
                My patience for troubleshooting my code is a test of the gods. When patience falls frustration clouds much needed clarity. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I can be a bit lazy with the application of some fundamentals and when they’re needed, I fall short. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At least I know I didn’t give up, even if it feels like I’m banging my head against a brick wall.
              </p>
              <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
              <p>
                Self-awareness provides much needed insight into how a student learns and where improvement can begin. Empathy is the driving force behind learning and works with self-awareness. The more we understand ourselves and other people the more connected we become.
              </p>
              <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
              <p>
                Putting it into practice and internalizing the results.
              </p>
              <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
              <p>
                Because studies show it works and helps with learning?
              </p>
              <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
              <p>
                I'm not entirely sure yet. I feel that it is working but I'm not sure how to prove that.
