              <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
              <p>
                I tend to overanalyze or make my solutions more convoluted than they need to be. This time I did it with the FuzzBizz challenge thinking I need a for loop for the first part. When I got stuck I was a bit lost on how to proceed. One of the worst parts of coding problems is that you don’t always know why you’re wrong. Is it the syntax? Is it Replit? I tried looking up the FuzzBizz problem online but that seemed to take me deeper down the rabbit hole. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My problem with FuzzBizz is that I took the code in the wrong direction by not fully understanding what was being asked in the tests. Luckily my faciliatory said she’d walk me through it in a one-on-one session. I’m still in the process of learning and internalizing this week and last week’s fundamentals.
              </p>
              <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
              <p>
                I am trying to write out the process I think will be the solution with Pseudocode. Not entirely confident that it's working.
              </p>
              <h3>Trying something</h3>
              <p>
                Finding something related to my current task on google and trying it out is kind of my main solution. Google is my God now, it has the answers.
              </p>
              <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
              <p>
                Tried it. My code was not "elegant". I was mostly concerned with passing the tests down the bottom and it came out very non-effecient.

              </p>
              <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
              <p>
                This was actually pretty helpful a majority of time. Other times it was like "What the hell are you talking about?"
              </p>
              <h3>Console Logging</h3>
              <p>
                Pretty similiar to reading error messages. They actually walk hand in hand I think.
              </p>
              <h3>Googling</h3>
              <p>

              <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
              <p>
                I mostly lurk. Someone has usually posted a similiar issue or problem.
              </p>
              <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
              <p>
                This I do. Asking the facilitator and having one on one session helps a lot.
              </p>
              <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
              <p>
                Like I've written before. I think my main issue that this week has taught me is that I might not be internalizing the fundamentals properly. I'm going to do extra research on these subjects and hoplefully something will stick.
